# Introduction

This repo is where all the Anasheed files reside.

# Contributions

All contributions are welcome, below is some instructions on how you can help.

## Site functionality and UI

If you want to help in the development of the website then go to the [site's repo](https://github.com/AnasheedArchive/Site) and follow the instructions there.

## Anasheed

### Requests

You can request a Nasheed to be added by sending an email to `AnasheedArchive@protonmail.com` that includes the name and the audio of the Nasheed, but I don't promise anything.

- The Nasheed should not contain any musical instruments.
- The Nasheed should be in Arabic or english.

### Adding a Nasheed

if you want to contribute a new Nasheed to the archive then simply download the [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnasheedArchive/Anasheed/main/template.md) and fill it as prescribed then send it by email to `AnasheedArchive@protonmail.com` with an image (optional) and the audio file / link.

- Arabic must have full harakat (diacritics).
- The Nasheed should not contain any musical instruments.
- If there's too many grammatical errors I will not be accept it.
- Currently only arabic and english Anasheed are accepted (unless I trust you).

### translating an existing Nasheed

*this also applies if you just want to add some information to a Nasheed or correct mistakes*

if you want to add translations to an existing Nasheed then head to that Nasheed's page on the site and scroll to the download section, then "download raw file".
edit that file and send it by email, if you want you can provide a name and a social link to be included in the contributors sections.

- Preferably translations are done word for word rather than conveying the meaning of the verse (unless it's impossible to do so).
- Currently only arabic and english Anasheed are accepted (unless i trust you).
- Translations must be the same verse count as the original language.

**don't forget to attach the audio file / link of the original Nasheed to the email!!!**
