# Introduction

This repo is where all the Anasheed files resides.

# Contributions

All contributions are welcome, below is some instructions on how you can help.

## Site functionality and UI

If you want to help in the development of the website then go to the [site's repo](https://github.com/AnasheedArchive/Site).

## Anasheed

First off you don't need any coding knowledge to contribute a nasheed, all you have to do is download the [nasheed template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnasheedArchive/Anasheed/main/template.md?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACPDMIXULYZD3TS5CJMF22DIZSLMSFA) (which is just a fancy text file), fill it in then send it by Email to `AnasheedArchive@protonmail.com`.

### Notes

- Currently only arabic and english Anasheed are accepted.
- The nasheed should not contain any musical instruments.
- Translations must be the same verse count as the original language.
- Preferably translations are done word by word rather than conveying the meaning of the verse.
- You can provide your name and social link in the contributor's section, but it's completely optional.

(**don't forget to attach an image and the audio file / link of the original nasheed to the email**).
